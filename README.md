## About Us

FDX Ingeniería is dedicated to creating cutting-edge technology solutions that promote sustainable practices and improve operational efficiency. With over twenty years of experience, our team develops IoT products and integrated monitoring systems that serve a wide range of industries, from urban infrastructure to remote environmental monitoring.

Our mission is to drive technological innovation that addresses real-world challenges, ensuring a positive impact on both industry and the environment.

## Projects

### 1. AMBA Sewage Network Monitoring
We have deployed an extensive IoT-based monitoring system for the largest sewage network in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (AMBA). This project includes over 190 monitoring points, using data loggers designed to withstand harsh conditions and provide real-time data to ensure optimal management of the sewage system.

### 2. Paraná Delta Water Level Monitoring
In the Paraná Delta, our IoT data loggers monitor water levels to help manage flood risks and support local communities. This challenging project involves installing equipment in hard-to-reach areas, ensuring low power consumption, and providing reliable data transmission even in areas with poor communication infrastructure.

## Technologies

- **IoT Data Loggers**: Devices designed to collect and transmit data under extreme conditions, utilizing technologies like LoRa, NB-IoT, and LTE-CAT-M1 for efficient communication.
- **FDX-CLOUD**: Our proprietary cloud platform that integrates data from various sensors and devices, offering advanced analytics, reporting, and integration with existing SCADA systems.
- **Predictive Algorithms**: Used in our monitoring systems to anticipate failures and optimize maintenance schedules, particularly in high-temperature environments.
